Client Package
##########

This package contains the main client interface and related components of the bot system.

The **Client** provides access to all available methods used to interact with the platform. You can explore the :doc:`bot/methods` section to discover the full list of supported methods.

Each method typically returns either a **type** (from :doc:`bot/types`) or a **response class** (from :doc:`bot/responses`), depending on the operation. Some methods may return complex structures defined in the `types` module, while others may use dedicated response wrappers.

To understand the structure of input or output data, see:

- :doc:`bot/types` — contains available data types used across methods.
- :doc:`bot/enums` — includes useful enumerations for request parameters.
- :doc:`bot/responses` — wraps and structures method responses when applicable.

If you're looking for how to perform a certain action, **start by checking the Client methods**. Once you find a method that matches your use case, refer to the relevant type or response class to understand what data you’ll receive or need to send.
