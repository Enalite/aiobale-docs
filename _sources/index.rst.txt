Aiobale — A Friendly Reverse-Engineered Bale API Client
=======================================================


**Aiobale** is an asynchronous Python client for the **Bale platform's internal API** — fully reverse-engineered, without any official `.proto` files or documentation.

This library provides a high-level interface over Bale’s low-level gRPC and Protobuf-based API, making it **simple and Pythonic to use**, thanks to its clean design, powerful aliases, and developer-friendly shortcuts.

Despite Bale’s API being highly obfuscated and undocumented, **Aiobale** gives you everything you need to work with it — whether you're building automation, scraping stats, or exploring internal features.

   ⚠️ Use this library at your own risk. Any usage that violates Bale's terms of service or policies may result in your account being banned — or even legal consequences.  
   We do **not** take responsibility for misuse. This project is for **educational and ethical use only**.

Built with 💻 Reverse Engineering
---------------------------------

Aiobale was built entirely from scratch by reverse-engineering the **Bale web client** and inspecting network traffic.  
We didn't have access to `.proto` files or official dev tools — just persistence, Wireshark, and a lot of trial and error.

The goal?  
Make one of the most complicated APIs usable in a single import.

Right now, the **team consists of just one developer**, but with your help, we can take this further.
